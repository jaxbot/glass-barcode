# Quick Glass QR / barcode scanning code

Here's some code I mashed up from ZXing and BarcodeEye. You should be able to drop this into your code and have a relatively simple QR Code scan activity, for reading in data, etc.

The MainActivity is an example of how it works.

If you have any questions, let me know!
